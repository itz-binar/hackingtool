HACKINGTOOL IMAGE UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS
=====================================

Based on the screenshots you've provided, here's how to update the images:

1. BACKUP (Already Done)
   - The original images have been backed up to a folder like "images/backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS"

2. MATCH SCREENSHOTS TO FILES
   - A00.png: The screenshot showing "Anonymously Hiding Tool" menu with [1] Anonymously Surf, [2] Multitor options
   - A0.png: The screenshot showing the main menu with the orange "HACKING TOOL" text
   - A1.png: The screenshot showing "Information Gathering Tools" menu with options like Nmap, Dracnmap, etc.
   - A2.png: The screenshot showing "Wireless Attack Tools" menu with WiFi-Pumpkin and other options
   - A4.png: The screenshot showing the Anonsurf tool with the skull icon

3. SAVE THE SCREENSHOTS
   - Save each screenshot with the correct filename in the images/ directory
   - Make sure to save them as PNG files
   - Replace the existing files with the same names

4. VERIFY IMAGES IN README
   - The README.md file references these images with the following paths:
     * https://github.com/itz-binar/hackingtool/blob/master/images/A00.png
     * https://github.com/itz-binar/hackingtool/blob/master/images/A0.png
     * https://github.com/itz-binar/hackingtool/blob/master/images/A1.png
     * https://github.com/itz-binar/hackingtool/blob/master/images/A2.png
     * https://github.com/itz-binar/hackingtool/blob/master/images/A4.png
   - These references don't need to be changed as they're already correctly formatted

5. IF YOU NEED TO RESTORE THE ORIGINAL IMAGES
   - Copy the images back from the backup directory that was created

Note: When you push these changes to your GitHub repository, the README will automatically display the updated screenshots.
